# E-Learning Platform (Frontend Web Project)

## Project Overview

This project is a **frontend-based E-Learning Platform** developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It simulates a basic online learning website where users can explore courses, watch educational videos, and track their learning progress. The application runs entirely in the browser and does not require any backend or server-side technologies, making it ideal for beginners learning web development.

The platform focuses on simplicity, clean UI, and core frontend concepts such as DOM manipulation, responsive design, and client-side data storage using **localStorage**. This project demonstrates how a real-world e-learning system works at a fundamental level.

---

## Project Objectives

- Build a responsive multi-page e-learning website
- Practice HTML structure and semantic elements
- Design modern UI using CSS
- Implement interactivity using JavaScript
- Track learning progress using browser localStorage
- Understand how frontend pages communicate using shared scripts and styles

---

## Technologies & Tools Used

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5** – For creating the structure of the web pages
- **CSS3** – For styling, layout, responsiveness, and UI design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – For dynamic behavior and logic

### Platform & Tools
- **Web Browser** (Google Chrome / Edge / Firefox)
- **Visual Studio Code** – Code editor used for development
- **YouTube Embed API** – For embedding course videos
- **GitHub** – For version control and project hosting

## Features

- **Course Listing**  
  Displays available courses with title, instructor name, description, and action button.

- **Search Functionality**  
  Real-time search to filter courses based on user input.

- **Video Learning**  
  Embedded YouTube videos for each course.

- **Progress Tracking**  
  Users can mark lessons complete, increasing progress in steps.

- **Persistent Storage**  
  Progress is saved using browser `localStorage`.

- **Easy Navigation**  
  Simple navbar to switch between Home, Courses, and My Learning.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## How It Works

When the user opens the website, they land on the Home page. From there, they can navigate to the Courses page to explore available learning options. Selecting a course redirects the user to the My Learning page where the corresponding video is loaded dynamically using URL parameters.

Each time the user clicks **"Mark Lesson Complete"**, the progress increases and is stored in the browser using `localStorage`. The progress section displays all started courses and allows the user to continue learning from where they left off, even after refreshing the page or reopening the browser.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the developer gains hands-on experience in:
- Frontend web development
- Multi-page website structure
- DOM manipulation
- Responsive design
- Client-side data storage
- Writing clean and maintainable code

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication
- Connect backend using Node.js
- Store data in a database
- Add quizzes and certificates
- Improve UI animations and transitions

---

## Conclusion

This E-Learning Platform is a complete beginner-friendly frontend project that showcases practical usage of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It is suitable for portfolios, college projects, and learning practice. The project can be expanded further with backend integration and advanced features.
